# Architecture modelling standards - an introduction

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to initiate discussions for companywide Architecture Modelling Standards. 

## Scope
The scope of this document is to provide an introduction to the topic of architecture modelling in DXC, including: vision, mission, and values. This document is not binding to anyone in DXC. 

## Assumptions
We assume that the reader is familiar with architecture modelling but it is not a prerequisite. 

## Audience
Architects, engineers, business analysts, project managers and almost any employees within the organisation.

# Why we are doing it
In this changing world, it is important do have a documentation which is accessible and understandable by anyone. The architects and engineers are creating diagrams and models on daily basis. We would like to help then in providing a common approach in creating the architecture documentation. When the architects, engineers and process owners will create the documentation using visual tools, modelling languages, in a consistent way, using the same language and approach, these artefacts will provide much more clarity and understanding, it will increase the quality of documentation and its usage.

# Mission
To define and govern clear guidelines, standards and modelling patterns that will be used to document architecture in DXC. Define DXC Architecture Modelling Meta Model, which will cover all aspects of DXC portfolio.

# Vision
